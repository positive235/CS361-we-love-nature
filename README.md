# CS361 Project - "We Love Nature"

"We Love Nature" for CS361(Software Engineering 1) project. 

1. Users can react(Like or Dislike) to nature images by swiping left or right, or pressing a Like/Dislike button. 

2. Users can see new set of nature images with Refresh button by using my microservice(Nature Image Web Scraper(https://github.com/positive235/CS361-image-web-scraper)). 

3. Users can style the image with Style button 

(Currently, a background image comes from other OSU student's image microservice - so, it takes a while to load the background image.)
